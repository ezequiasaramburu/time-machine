        title: "Alan Turing publishes 'On Computable Numbers' introducing the Turing Machine concept.",
        impact: "This groundbreaking paper laid the theoretical foundation for modern computing and artificial intelligence. Turing's concept of a universal machine that could simulate any other machine's computation was revolutionary. It introduced the idea of programmability and the theoretical limits of computation. The Turing Machine concept became fundamental to computer science theory, helping define what is computable and what isn't. This work also led to the development of the Church-Turing thesis, which states that any effectively calculable function can be computed by a Turing Machine. The paper's influence extends beyond theoretical computer science, as it helped establish the mathematical foundation for the digital computers that would be built decades later."
